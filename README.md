# tmu-webring

A webring for Computer Science and Software Engineering students at Toronto Metropolitan University

Idea inspired by [Waterloo's SE Webring](https://github.com/simcard0000/se-webring), [McGill's Webring](https://github.com/leofalvo/mcgillcswebring.org), and ['Carlton's Webring](https://github.com/yufengliu15/cu-webring).

## What is a webring?

A [webring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) is a group of websites linked together in a circular structure, usually organized around a specific theme, and often educational or social. In our case, the webring is not circular, and much closer to a [hub and spoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoke%E2%80%93hub_distribution_paradigm). This is because asking everyone to update their website when someone adds/removes theirs would be near impossible, and would discourage the use of the webring.

The idea behind this webring is to bring exposure and traffic to your personal website, with the hopes of creating a more community-like experience during your time at TMU.

## How do I join?

To add your site, you MUST be a current student or alumni at [Toronto Metropolitan University](https://www.torontomu.ca/).

2. Add your details in `src/resources/sites.ts` to the end of the `sites` array. The 4 values are:

    - Full Name
    - Year Admitted to Toronto Metropolitan University
    - Website URL (must be **your** personal website)
    - Top 2 Skills (**Optional**, this is for adding your website to the graph and just for fun! Add two of your top skills in the array such as programming languages or frameworks)
    - Top 2 Employers (**Optional**, this is for adding your website to the graph and just for fun! Add two of your top co-op employers in the array)

3. Optional, but **please mention the webring** somewhere on your website. Preferably, have it link back to the main site.
